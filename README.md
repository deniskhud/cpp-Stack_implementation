# Stack Implementation in C++

This repository contains an implementation of a stack data structure using a linked list in C++. It includes basic stack operations such as `push`, `pop`, `Top`, and `Size`. The stack also handles error conditions when trying to access the top element of an empty stack.

## Features

- Push elements onto the stack (`push`).
- Pop elements from the stack (`pop`).
- Access the top element of the stack (`Top`).
- Check if the stack is empty (`isEmpty`).
- Get the size of the stack (`Size`).
- Print the elements of the stack (`print`).
- Exception handling for `Top` on empty stack.
